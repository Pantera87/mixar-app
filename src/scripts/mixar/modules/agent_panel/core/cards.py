"""The one writer of the ``wm.mixar_agent_cards`` mirror.

The chat's ``todo`` slot carries the running turn's task list — the same list
the orchestrator fans out to parallel agents (``emit_todo`` in the backend,
one entry per ``Task``). ``slot_processor._apply_todo_slot`` hands it here and
this module projects it onto the WindowManager mirror the C++ Parallel Agents
panel draws from.

**Diff-update, never clear-and-rebuild.** RNA idprop writes fire ``NC_WINDOW``
plus a depsgraph tag, and todo slots stream at turn cadence; wiping and
re-adding the whole collection on every event — with a redrawing viewport
region now reading it — is a repaint storm. The collection is rebuilt only
when the *membership* changes; a status flip patches one property in place.

Timings are monotonic-clock readings, not wall clock, so the elapsed figure on
a card cannot jump when the system clock is adjusted. They are stamped on
transitions here (the backend streams status, not timing) and carried across a
membership rebuild so a card that survives keeps its clock.
