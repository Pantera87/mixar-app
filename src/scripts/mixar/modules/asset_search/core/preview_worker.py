"""Parent-side management of the headless preview-render workers.

For large training plans, preview rendering runs in SEPARATE windowless
Mixar/Blender processes (``-b --factory-startup --python preview_worker_script``)
so the user's session never freezes. Each worker streams one JSON line per
finished asset into its own ``results.jsonl``; the training modal polls them for
real-time progress and loads the produced JPEGs (packed) when done.

Big plans are SHARDED across several processes (rendering is CPU-bound and
perfectly parallel). Shards are split on **.blend boundaries** so no two
processes open — or, during thumbnail backfill, save — the same library file,
and so each shard keeps the benefit of the linked-library reuse in
``preview_worker_script`` (consecutive items from one file are parsed once).

Fallback contract: any failure to start — or workers that die before producing
a single result — makes the caller fall back to the in-process chunked
RenderSession, so training always works.
