"""Streaming uploads — send finished previews WHILE rendering continues.

Training used to render every asset, then upload. The two phases are
independent (rendering is local CPU, uploading is network + server-side
embedding), so a large run spent minutes rendering with the network idle and
then minutes uploading with the CPU idle. Here the render loop hands finished
assets to a ``BatchBuilder`` as they land and ONE uploader thread posts each
batch as it fills, so the upload cost disappears into the render time.

Ordering is strictly sequential and matters: batch 1 may carry ``mode=full``
(which REPLACES the user's index) plus the removed-asset list, and the batch
carrying ``metadata_checksum`` must be the LAST one — the checksum marks the
library fully embedded, so stamping it early would mark un-uploaded assets as
trained. ``BatchBuilder`` therefore holds the newest completed batch back until
another one exists, which makes the final batch knowable without spending an
extra credit-metered request just to stamp the checksum.
