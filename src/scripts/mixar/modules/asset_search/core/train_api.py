"""Training network layer — prepare + BATCHED image upload.

Runs in background threads (no ``bpy`` access). The upload is split into
batches so (a) upload/server-embedding progress ticks in real time instead of
one opaque multi-minute POST, and (b) a failure mid-way loses only the current
batch — everything already uploaded is durable and the next training run's
/train/prepare diff resumes from there.

Batching contract with the backend:
- ``full`` mode: batch 1 is sent mode="full" (replaces the old index), batches
  2+ ride mode="incremental" — net effect equals one full retrain.
- ``incremental`` mode: every batch is mode="incremental"; removed_assets go
  with batch 1 only.
- The full-library metadata_checksum is sent ONLY with the LAST batch: it must
  not be stamped until every asset is in, so an interrupted run reads as stale
  (diff-recoverable), never as complete.
