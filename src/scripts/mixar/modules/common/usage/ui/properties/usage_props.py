"""WindowManager mirror of the cached usage snapshot.

The profile card is drawn in C++ (`interface_mixar_profile_card.cc`),
which cannot reach a Python module-level cache — so the snapshot that
``core/state.py`` owns is mirrored onto RNA here, and the card reads
these properties.

**WindowManager, never Scene**: this is session state that must not be
serialized into a ``.blend`` (a shared file would carry one user's plan
and credit balance to whoever opens it). ``mixie_chat_user_id`` uses
process-local RNA accessors; ``SKIP_SAVE`` alone does not protect Scene data.

``core/state.py`` stays the source of truth; these are a projection of
it, written on the main thread by ``core/poller._apply_snapshot``.
