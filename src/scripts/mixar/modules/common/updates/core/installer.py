Self-Install Orchestration

Platform-neutral answers to three questions:

1. *Can this copy of Mixar update itself?* (:func:`check_eligibility`)
2. *Apply the staged installer and restart.* (:func:`begin_install`)
3. *What happened to the update we started last time?*
   (:func:`consume_result`)

Everything that differs per OS lives in :mod:`win_installer` and
:mod:`mac_installer`; this module decides which to call and never touches
the UI.
