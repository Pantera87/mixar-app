Update Install Flow

The stateful glue between detection and installation: owns the download
thread, moves :class:`InstallState` along, and turns "Restart & Update"
into a spawned helper plus a quit.

Threading contract — the download runs on a daemon thread that touches
only :mod:`state` (which is lock-guarded) and the filesystem.  Everything
that reads ``bpy`` or the notification store is bounced to the main
thread with ``bpy.app.timers.register``.
