Update Toasts

Every notification the update system shows, in one place, rendered from
the current :mod:`state` rather than from whatever the caller happened to
know.  One toast id (``UPDATE_NOTIFICATION_ID``) is reused throughout, so
"available", "downloading", "ready to install" and "update failed" are
successive renderings of the same toast instead of a pile-up.
