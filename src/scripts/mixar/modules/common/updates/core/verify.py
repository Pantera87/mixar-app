Installer Signature Verification

The checksum in :mod:`download` proves the bytes match what the backend
published.  This module answers the other half: that what the backend
published was signed by **the same publisher as the copy already
running**.  It is the check that makes an unattended, elevated install
defensible — a compromised release row can change the checksum it
advertises, but not the signing identity of the app the user installed.

Comparing against the running app rather than a hardcoded identity means
a certificate rotation needs no client release, and a dev/unsigned build
degrades to "checksum only" instead of refusing to update at all.

Both checks shell out to the platform tools (``Get-AuthenticodeSignature``
/ ``codesign``); a tool that cannot be run is reported as
:data:`UNVERIFIED`, never as a failure.
