Topbar Update Badge

Persistent "Update Available" indicator drawn just right of the topbar
"Open Mixie" button (called from agent_bubble's TOPBAR_HT_upper_bar
draw hook).  Visible whenever update info is cached in the update state
singleton — including after the toast has been dismissed or the version
has already been announced, so the badge persists until they are actually
on the latest release. Once ready, clicking opens the same restart
confirmation as the toast button. Otherwise it re-shows the sticky update
toast, which makes suppressing repeat announcements safe: the update is
demoted to ambient status, never withheld.
