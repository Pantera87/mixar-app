"""Bounded, verified, retryable result-file download.

Split out of ``model_io`` because the transfer needs real policy rather
than a read loop. Three production defects motivated each piece:

- ``urlopen(timeout=...)`` is a *per-read* socket timeout, so a trickling
  transfer reset it forever and a finished job sat in "Downloading…" for
  10+ minutes holding a concurrency slot. Hence a total deadline enforced
  between chunks (:data:`DOWNLOAD_TOTAL_DEADLINE_S`).
- The read loop stopped at EOF and returned the path, so a connection that
  closed early produced a partial ``.glb`` that was then imported. Hence
  the ``Content-Length`` check.
- A transient failure permanently failed a job whose result URL was still
  valid. Hence bounded retries — but never for a 4xx, because these are
  presigned S3 URLs and an expired one will not start working.

Runs on the queue's background download thread: imports no ``bpy`` and
touches no Blender state. ``on_progress`` and ``should_cancel`` are invoked
on that same thread, so callers must only read/write plain values in them.
