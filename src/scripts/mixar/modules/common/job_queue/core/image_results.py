"""Image result transfer: parallel download + batched moodboard apply.

One job's result urls download CONCURRENTLY (pool capped at 4) into
indexed slots so board order equals URL order no matter which transfer
finishes first; the main-thread _apply stays ONE batch so the undo push,
the on_added provenance hook and on_done each fire exactly once per job.
Latency contract pinned in tests/test_job_queue_image_results.py and
documented in CLAUDE.md's Unified Job Queue section.

    ----------
    urls : list[str]
        Image URLs to download.
    name_prefix : str
        Prefix for bpy.data.images names (e.g. ``"imagegen"``).
    prompt : str
        Prompt text stored with the moodboard entry.
    job_id : str
        Job ID for moodboard handle tracking.
    on_done : callable(names_str)
        Called on main thread with comma-separated image names.
    on_added : callable(names_str), optional
        Called after moodboard insertion but before the undo snapshot. Use for
        durable metadata/placement that redo must restore with the image.
        Failure rolls back the new cards and image datablocks.
    on_error : callable(error_str)
        Called on main thread if all downloads fail.
    undo_message : str, optional
        If set, pushes an undo step with this message after adding images.
    scene_name : str, optional
        Originating Blender scene. Queue jobs set this so changing the active
        scene while a download runs cannot redirect the generated images.
    should_apply : callable, optional
        Main-thread cancellation guard. When false, downloaded temp files are
        discarded without inserting images or firing completion callbacks.
