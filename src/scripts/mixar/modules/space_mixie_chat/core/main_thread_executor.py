"""
Async script execution queue for main thread execution.

The WebSocket thread queues ExecutionRequests (never executes scripts); a
main-thread timer executes ONE script per tick, so the UI never freezes; the
response goes straight to the WebSocket client's outbound queue
(``client.queue_response``) — cross-thread queue polling segfaulted
Blender's embedded Python.

Per-tab lanes (one FIFO per chat session, round-robin, prefetch holds) live
in ``script_lanes``. The take/execute/respond sequence lives in
``mixar.modules.common.agent_execution.pump`` and is shared with the headless
worker pump (``headless/headless_main.py``); scene routing and history live in
``main_thread_routing``.
