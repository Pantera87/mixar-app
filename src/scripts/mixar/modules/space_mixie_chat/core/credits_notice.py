"""
Credit-exhausted Mixie chat message.

The toast surface is owned by ``common.notifications.credit_upgrade`` (same
mechanism as the "update available" toast). This module adds the *second*
surface the product wants: a message in the Mixie chat window carrying an
"Upgrade" call-to-action.

The CTA button reuses the toast's operator (``mixar.open_credit_upgrade``) via
the ``CREDIT_UPGRADE_CHAT_ACTION`` sentinel, so the seamless auth handoff to the
manage-subscription page is shared between both surfaces.

``add_credit_upgrade_chat_message`` mutates ``scene.mixie_chat_messages`` and
MUST be called on the main thread (a Blender operator or a main-thread timer /
``run_on_main_thread`` callback) — never directly from the WebSocket thread.
