"""Client-local wizard for a batched choice interrupt.

The backend sends every independent question of a batch in ONE
``input_required`` event (its ``questions`` slot). Answering them one at a
time over the network would put a full graph round-trip between each card,
so the user waits on the backend just to SEE the next question. This module
removes that wait: each click is recorded locally, the next card is rendered
from the payload already sitting on the bubble, and only the final click
resumes the graph — carrying the complete answer map.

The next card is rendered by replaying the very slot event the backend would
have sent for it (``content`` + ``actions``) through the normal slot
processor. That is deliberate: a card drawn by writing ``bubble.content``
directly would keep the PREVIOUS question on screen, because the C++ renderer
lays out and draws from the parsed ``markdown_segments`` metadata and a
layout-cache epoch, neither of which a bare attribute write updates. Going
through the slot pipeline keeps local cards and backend cards pixel-identical
by construction.
