"""Clip-aware export (``animations``, export contract §3).

``animations`` is ``None`` (every clip the exporter would include), ``[]``
(no animation) or a list of names that match an Action name or an NLA
strip name on an exported armature — case-sensitive first, then
case-insensitive. ``clip_selection`` mutes the non-matching NLA tracks for
the duration of the export and force-unmutes the matching ones (pushing a
matching active action onto a temporary track when it is not on one);
mute state, active action and the current frame are restored in ``finally``.
