"""
Clipboard operators for Mixie Chat.

Handles paste operations for text and images.

Note: The per-bubble copy button is handled entirely in C++
(mixie_chat_hit_testing.cc → WM_clipboard_text_set). These Python
operators are only for keyboard/menu-driven copy and paste.

Three paste entry points, deliberately kept distinct:

* ``mixie_chat.paste_image`` — image only. It returns ``CANCELLED`` when the
  clipboard holds no image, and ``interface_handlers.cc`` depends on that:
  while the composer is in text-edit mode the C++ hook calls this operator
  first and, on ``CANCELLED``, runs its own ``ui_textedit_copypaste`` so text
  lands at the cursor. Do not give this operator a text fallback.
* ``mixie_chat.paste`` — the keymap-bound chord. Image first, then text.
  This is the path taken whenever the composer does *not* hold text-edit
  focus, which is the normal state after the window has been deactivated —
  and it is exactly the state an external dictation / paste utility leaves
  behind when it injects Ctrl/Cmd+V. Before this operator existed the plain
  chord was bound to ``paste_image`` alone, so every such paste was silently
  dropped.
* ``mixie_chat.paste_text`` — text only, for menus and scripts.
