"""Agent Bubble — composer footer.

Two stacked rows:

  1. Multi-line input via draw_multiline_text_input (the same wrapper
     mixie chat uses):
       * 1 line by default
       * Auto-grows to 4 lines as the user types or hits Shift+Enter
       * Internal scroll once content exceeds 4 lines
       * Shift+Enter inserts a newline; Enter submits (the
         interface_handlers.cc \\x1F submit-marker patch already
         covers SPACE_AGENT_BUBBLE)
  2. Action row with the Mode dropdown, the attachment control, and
     the Send icon-button on the right.

The C++ footer region prefsizey is sized to host the 1-line default
plus the action row (≈ 90 px). When the input expands past 1 line,
the wrapper scales its column vertically; if that pushes the
composer beyond the region, the wrapper's own scroll handles
overflow rather than clipping content out of view.
