Multi-View Submit Payload

Turns the Model Gen tab's Input Image plus its turnaround group into the
multi-view fragment of a 3D-generation job payload. Split out of
:mod:`turnaround_views` (which owns the group data model) to stay under the
500-line file limit; the dependency runs one way, payload -> data model.

Shape, frozen against ``POST /job-queue/jobs``::

    {"image_s3_key": "<input image key>",
     "multi_view_images": [{"s3_key": "...", "view_type": "left"}, ...]}

The Input Image is the vendor's single frontal image and is NEVER a group
member, so it can never leak into ``multi_view_images``.

    within one payload.

    dropped with a warning here rather than submitted for the vendor to reject
