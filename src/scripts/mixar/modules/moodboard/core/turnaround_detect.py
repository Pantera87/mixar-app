Turnaround / Model-Sheet View Detection

Calls ``POST /api/v1/model-3d/detect-views`` with a turnaround sheet and
brings the returned per-view crops onto the moodboard. The group model itself
(queries, labelling, submit payload) lives in :mod:`turnaround_views`.

Backend contract, and how each panel is ingested:

- ``panels[0].view_type`` is always ``"main"`` — the sheet's front
  orthographic, falling back to its hero render when there is no front. It
  becomes the tab's **Input Image** and is NOT a group member.
- ``"hero"`` appears only when the sheet has BOTH. No vendor ``ViewType``
  describes it, so it is not a companion either: it lands on the moodboard
  untagged next to the main, as an alternative Input Image the user can
  promote when a stylised sheet reconstructs badly.
- everything else is one of the seven vendor angles and joins the group.

Both main and hero keep their ``s3_key``, so whichever one ends up as the
Input Image submits by key instead of re-uploading pixels.

Threading: the detect request runs on the shared async request queue, whose
callbacks are delivered on Blender's main thread. Crop pixels are downloaded
on a worker thread and handed back to the main thread before touching
``bpy.data``.
