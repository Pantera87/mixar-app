"""Workflow templates: one Add-menu entry that builds a framed graph of drafts.

A workflow is listed in ``NODE_TEMPLATES`` like any node template, so every
entry point (canvas strip, + menu, Shift+A, pie, native drag) offers it without
knowing it is special. Only availability and creation branch on it.

A ``hidden`` workflow stays registered and buildable but is never available, so
no entry point lists it and creation refuses it. Boards that already hold the
graph it built are untouched: that graph is ordinary frames and cards.

Pure data plus two predicates: safe to call from a menu draw.
