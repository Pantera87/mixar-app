"""Multi-View Set Operators

Everything that edits the Model Gen tab's multi-view (turnaround) set:
``Add Selected`` (the primary path — takes the moodboard selection and
auto-assigns angles), the secondary file picker, per-row remove and promote,
and the group-wide clear. Detection itself lives in ``detect_views_ops.py``.

The set holds COMPANIONS ONLY — the vendor takes one frontal image plus up to
seven angles, and the frontal image is the tab's Input Image. That frontal
image is also what the set is BOUND to (``turnaround_main_group``): the set
rides along only when that exact image is the one being generated from. Every
operator here that creates, re-points or empties a set has to maintain that
marker, or the set silently stops applying (or worse, keeps applying after it
should have gone). ``Promote`` is how the input image gets swapped: the
promoted view leaves the set (there is no vendor angle that describes a front
view, so it cannot stay) and takes the marker with it, while the old input
image drops back into the set as a companion at the angle just freed.

The tab's group id (see ``core/turnaround_views.py``) says which set these
operators edit, so they work identically whichever image source the tab uses.
