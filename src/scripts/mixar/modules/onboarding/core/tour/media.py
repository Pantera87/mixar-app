"""
Interactive tour — which video, narration and beat table play.

``resolve(tour, language)`` decides once, at tour start:

* a complete, verified pack for ``language`` whose ``timing.json`` fits the
  bundled script → that language's parts (``PartsMovie``, one joined audio
  clock) with the re-timed ``Tour``, ``narration == language``;
* anything else → the bundled English video, the English table and
  ``narration == "en"``; the session then shows ``language``'s subtitles.

The decision is a pure function of what is on disk so it is unit-tested
with a temp cache; opening the media (``open_media``) is the only step that
touches Blender.
